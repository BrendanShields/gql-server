# GQL Server

This is my second delve into the world of graphQL. This time I have used other services such as Prisma and Heroku to deploy and add futher functionality.

## Check out the live demo here.

### Usage

This site was not intended for others to use, rather, I am building a website for an Indigenous charity here in Sydney and this is the initial backend setup.

If you did want to clone the repo the instructions are below.

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local environment with this URL: https://github.com/BrendanShields/gql-server.git

npm install the missing node packages.

You will need to create env files for usage with prisma, and heroku.

then once all of that is set up run npm run dev.

If you have any further questions shoot me a message!
